        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded with passion and purpose, <strong>Joy's Luxury</strong> began as a
          small boutique in 2022. Our mission has always been simple ‚Äî to blend
          timeless design, comfort, and confidence into every piece of clothing,
          shoe, or bag we craft. From our humble beginnings, we‚Äôve grown into a
          trusted name in fashion, bringing quality and affordability together
          for the modern trendsetter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every thread we sew and every stitch we design reflects the beauty and
          brilliance of a diamond ‚Äî unique, polished, and made to stand out.
